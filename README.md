## **First Assignment**

### *February 1st*

#### Difficulties 

#### 1. The first problem I faced was when I wanted to use multiple different font sizes and it wouldn'y really change because there had to be a space after the hashtag.

#### 2. I tried to make the skin tone of the face a bit beige to be believable as skin tone, however, it ended up being a bit reddish. 

#### 3. I tried to make a triangle, however, I couldn't position it in the area I wanted it to be in so, it looked extremely weird. Therefore, I went with rectangles for the body. It was hard for me to control the dimentions of the rectangle as it has six arguments. 

# *more about my assignment*

I used circles and rectangles to make the essential parts of the body. I really enjoyed playing around with colors. I think I got a better sense of how the coordinates of every shape work.
